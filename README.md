# my personal config forked from TJ's kickstart

heavily tailored to myself

## good for

- rust development
- navigation with telescope and marks (grapple tags)
- debugging with trouble

## needs

- nightly build of neovim, at least v0.10 for inline hints
- rust-analyzer ```rustup component add rust-analyzer```

## doing rn

[ ] run statusline grapple update on autocmd?
[ ] grapple smart add to taglist
[x] lualine-grapple-integration basic
